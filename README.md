xborder shows a colored border around an X window. It does this by creating a new X window with the color as a background, and then reparenting the chosen window to be a child of the border window. A child window is chosen by clicking on the window when xborder starts up, similar to how xwininfo works.

Run `xborder configure` and click on an existing xborder window to bring up the options dialog box. I bind `F1` to `xborder` and `F2` to `xborder configure` so it is easy to execute.
